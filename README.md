Two programmers' second attempt at writing a chess engine.

### First Attempt
  - [Cirno Chess Engine](<https://github.com/DoormatIka/cirno-chess-engine>) - FP is hell to work with in chess engines. This attempt will use OOP.

### Stuff Implemented
  - BasicBot (Cirno)
    - Alpha-beta Pruning
    - Material Counting
    - Fail-High
    - Piece-square tables

### Todo
  - Switch to cozy-chess due to a bug in chess
  - UCI (Needed.)
  - Iterative Deepening
